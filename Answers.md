1.also try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference?
2.list.remove(5); // what does this method do?
        This removes the item at the 5th index of the list. It does not matter
        what the value of the integer at that index is.
3.list.remove(Integer.valueOf(5)); // what does this one do?
        This removes the first instance of the integer 5 in the list. The method
        interates through the list and the first time it hits the indicated
        value, it removes that value.
